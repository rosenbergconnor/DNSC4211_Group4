########################
#1)Discount Pickup times becasue they have the same mean and close SDs
#2)Looked at delivery time per mile and saw that for delivery miles greater than about 10, C2, Red, was the quickest. At lower mileages, they were all pretty close
#SD of the delivery time has C2, Red, at the lowest making it the most reliable
#3)Looked at Cost per mile and saw red was cheaper than green and black at milages greater than about 10 miles
# anything less than about 10 miles, red and green had relitivly similar proices
#AS milage increases, the red and black costs will converge at about 30 miles. With deliveries less than 30 miles, Red will always be cheaper than black
